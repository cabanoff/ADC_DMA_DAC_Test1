  * @brief  Configure ADC (ADC instance: ADC1) and GPIO used by ADC channels.
  * @note   In case re-use of this function outside of this example:
  *         This function includes checks of ADC hardware constraints before
  *         executing some configuration functions.
  *         - In this example, all these checks are not necessary but are
  *           implemented anyway to show the best practice usages
  *           corresponding to reference manual procedure.
  *           (On some STM32 series, setting of ADC features are not
  *           conditioned to ADC state. However, in order to be compliant with
  *           other STM32 series and to show the best practice usages,
  *           ADC state is checked anyway with same constraints).
  *           Software can be optimized by removing some of these checks,
  *           if they are not relevant considering previous settings and actions
  *           in user application.
  *         - If ADC is not in the appropriate state to modify some parameters,
  *           the setting of these parameters is bypassed without error
  *           reporting:
  *           it can be the expected behavior in case of recall of this 
  *           function to update only a few parameters (which update fullfills
  *           the ADC state).
  *           Otherwise, it is up to the user to set the appropriate error 
  *           reporting in user application.
  * @note   Peripheral configuration is minimal configuration from reset values.
  *         Thus, some useless LL unitary functions calls below are provided as
  *         commented examples - setting is default configuration from reset.
